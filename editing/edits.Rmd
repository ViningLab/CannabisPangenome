# Main


## Trio-phased, haplotype-resolved chromosome-scale Cannabis “anchor” genome



## Cannabis pangenome uncovers at least five distinct populations


## The evolution of the cannabis genome is a history of transposable element movement


## The Cannabis pangenome displays high levels of structural variation


## Pan-genes and Pan-chromosomes 

- R-genes
- Terpenes


## The cannabinoid pathway is both variable and domesticated


## Varin cannabinoids (THCV and CBDV) are associated with complex variation in fatty acid biosynthesis gene




# Conclusions




## TE libraries
